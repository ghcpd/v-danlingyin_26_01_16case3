You are a frontend engineer.
Create a small but complete frontend project from scratch
according to input_ui_spec.txt.
Evaluation focus:
- Can the agent create a runnable app
- Can it organize code reasonably
- Can it implement basic filtering logic
You MUST output:
- A real project structure
- Actual source code
- A README with run instructions

GitHub Copilot: Optimizing tool selection...I'll create a complete frontend project for the Book Library Catalog based on the spec. This will be a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript application that can run directly in a browser.

I've created a complete Book Library Catalog application. Here's what was built:

## Project Structure

```
book-library/
├── index.html      # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css      # Modern styling with responsive design
├── app.js          # Application logic (add, display, filter, remove)
└── README.md       # Documentation with run instructions
```

## Features Implemented

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Add Books** | Form to add books with title and author |
| **Display List** | Shows all books with title and author info |
| **Filter by Author** | Real-time filtering as you type |
| **Remove Books** | Delete individual books |
| **Persistence** | Data saved to localStorage |

## How to Run

**Simplest method**: Open index.html directly in your browser by double-clicking it.

**Alternative options** (from the README):
- Use VS Code Live Server extension
- Run `python -m http.server 8000` in the book-library folder
- Use any static file server

## Code Organization

- **index.html** - Clean semantic HTML with form inputs and list container
- **styles.css** - Modern CSS with gradients, animations, and mobile responsiveness  
- **app.js** - Modular JavaScript with:
  - `addBook()` - Add new books
  - `filterBooksByAuthor()` - Core filtering logic
  - `renderBooks()` - DOM rendering
  - `saveToLocalStorage()` / `loadFromLocalStorage()` - Persistence

The app requires no backend, no external APIs, and no build tools - it runs directly in the browser!

Made changes.
